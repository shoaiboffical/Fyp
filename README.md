Freelancing Platform
The freelancing platform is a decentralized platform on the Ethereum Blockchain for freelancers and employers.

Story
An employer adds a project including a name and a price. The newly created project's status is Open. The employer also sends the price in Ether to the smart contract as a guarantee. A freelancer could pick a project with the status Open. As the freelancer picks the project, the project's status changes to Not Done. After completing the project, the freelancer could commit the project, and the project's status changes to Done. If the employer verifies the project by closing it, the smart contract will send the price to the freelancer, and the project's status will change to Close.
